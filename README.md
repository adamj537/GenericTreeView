# GenericTreeView
This is a generic project (inspired by https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23297/Generic-TreeView) which displays members of a serializable class as nodes on a tree view.  Eventually, the hope is to expand this into an editor for the serializable class.  But first step is to visualize it with the tree view :)
